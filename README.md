# Landing-page
This is a project from "The Odin project".

Its a main page or "Landing page" for a website.
The theme is what would a recruitment notice for samurai look if it was done in the modern times.

The page utilises a flex display to be presentable no matter the screen size.The body is in a column flex direction
which then consists of smaller "containers" that act as different sections (header,footer etc).Those are created in 
the default flex direction.
